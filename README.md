Container Security Assessment Project
 Overview:
This repository documents a container security assessment performed on the OWASP Juice Shop application using Trivy vulnerability scanner.
The project demonstrates hands-on container security testing, vulnerability analysis, and reporting â€” bridging practical cybersecurity skills with DevSecOps practices.

 Project Scope:
Target Application: OWASP Juice Shop (intentionally vulnerable app)
Assessment Tool: Trivy v0.65.0

Container Platform: Docker

Base OS: Debian 12.11


ðŸ“Š Key Findings Summary
Severity	Count	Percentage
Critical	8	14.8%
High	21	38.9%
Medium	22	40.7%
Low	3	5.6%
Total	54	100%

 Critical Vulnerabilities:
CVE-2023-32314 â€“ VM2 Sandbox Escape (vm2 package)
CVE-2015-9235 â€“ JWT Verification Bypass (jsonwebtoken package)
CVE-2023-46233 â€“ Weak cryptography (crypto-js)
CVE-2020-15084 â€“ Express-JWT Authorization Bypass


 Secrets Detected:
JWT tokens exposed in config files
Asymmetric private keys in source code
Hardcoded credentials in container configuration

 Technical Implementation:
Tools & Technologies
Trivy â€“ vulnerability & secrets scanner
Docker â€“ container platform
Node.js â€“ runtime environment
Debian Linux â€“ base OS
npm â€“ dependency management

Scanning Commands
# Install & setup
sudo apt update
sudo apt install trivy -y
trivy --version

# Run OWASP Juice Shop
sudo docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop

# Scan Juice Shop
sudo trivy image bkimminich/juice-shop -f table -o juice-secrets.txt
sudo trivy image bkimminich/juice-shop -f json -o juice-full.json

# Run DVWA
sudo docker run --rm -p 8080:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa

# Scan DVWA
sudo trivy image vulnerables/web-dvwa -f table -o dvwa-report.txt
sudo trivy image vulnerables/web-dvwa -f json -o dvwa-report.json

 
 Assessment Methodology:
Container Image Analysis â€“ scanned all Docker layers
Dependency Scanning â€“ Node.js + system packages
Secrets Detection â€“ checked for exposed keys & credentials
OS-level Analysis â€“ base Debian vulnerabilities
Configuration Review â€“ container security posture


 Results & Analysis:
High-Impact Issues
Authentication bypass via weak JWT handling
Sandbox escape â†’ arbitrary code execution
Weak cryptographic implementations
Outdated and unsupported dependencies

Skills Showcased:
Immediate Fixes
Update critical dependencies (vm2, jsonwebtoken, crypto-js)
Remove hardcoded secrets from source code
Implement secure secrets management


Long-Term Enhancements:
Automate scanning in CI/CD pipelines
Use minimal, supported base images
Apply multi-stage Docker builds
Regularly update dependencies
